## Usage

All the data we used and generated are stored in [data](https://github.com/ArthDh/ECE-143/tree/main/data) folder, and the clustering model we generated are stored in [model](https://github.com/ArthDh/ECE-143/tree/main/model) folder.

### Data Visualization

Visualizations of the correlation between raw features from dataset are presented in final notebook in [notebooks](https://github.com/ArthDh/ECE-143/tree/main/notebooks) folder.<br>
For a better viewing experience and interactibility view notebook here [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ArthDh/ECE-143/blob/main/notebooks/Final_Notebook_updated.ipynb)

### Clustering

We used K-mean for clustering and all visualizations regarding K-mean are also showed in final notebook. The original data used for hyper dimensional visualization are stoed in [data](https://github.com/ArthDh/ECE-143/tree/main/data) folder, named df_cleaned.tsv and df_cleaned_genre_10.tsv.

### Artist Recommendation

Go to the final notebook, change the sample name to your favorite artist and change the lim to the length of the recommendation list you want, and run the notebook.
